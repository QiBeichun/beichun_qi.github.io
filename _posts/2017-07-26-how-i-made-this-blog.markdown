This is my first personal website.
I used github pages, which is a very useful function of [github][github], and resources from [jekyll themes][jekyll-themes].

[github]: https://github.com/
[jekyll-themes]: http://jekyllthemes.org/
First create a new repository, choose a template from jekyll themes and fork it.  Then all you have to do is editing them in your repository to add details.

This barely requires any professional skill, and detailed guidence can be found on [jekyllrb.com][jekyllrb.com].

If you're interested in making your own website, I highly recommend you to check it out.
