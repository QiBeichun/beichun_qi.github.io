This is my first self-made blog.
Well, not entirely.
I used github pages, which is a very useful function of [gitgub][github], and resources from [jekyll themes][jekyllthemes].
[github]: https://github.com/
[jekyllthemes]: http://jekyllthemes.org/
No professional skill required, this is pretty easy to learn for everyone.
