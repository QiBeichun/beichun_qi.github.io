This is my first self-made blog.
Well, not entirely.
I used github pages, which is a very useful function of [github][github], and resources from [jekyll themes][jekyll-themes].

[github]: https://github.com/
[jekyll-themes]: http://jekyllthemes.org/
No professional skill required, this is pretty easy to learn for everyone.

Feel interested?
Go check it out!
