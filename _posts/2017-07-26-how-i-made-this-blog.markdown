This is my first blog.
I used github pages, which is a very useful function of [github][github], and resources from [jekyll themes][jekyll-themes].

[github]: https://github.com/
[jekyll-themes]: http://jekyllthemes.org/
No professional skill required, this is pretty easy to learn for everyone.

If you're interested in making yourself a website, I recommend you to check it out.
