This is my first personal website.
I used github pages, which is a very useful function of [github][github], and resources from [jekyll themes][jekyll-themes].

[github]: https://github.com/
[jekyll-themes]: http://jekyllthemes.org/
First create a new repository, change the settings to generate a site,
No professional skill required, this is pretty easy to learn for everyone.

If you're interested in making your own website, I recommend you to check it out.
