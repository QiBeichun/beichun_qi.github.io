Abstract:
This work concerns on the spark-ignition and fuel-injection control strategy for Haima 479Q-BA four-cylinder four-stoke electronically controlled gasoline engine. By analyzing the synchronization work process between crankshaft, camshaft position signals and the sequence control of ignition and injection, a method is creatively proposed to realize position identification of missing teeth, and an event-driven based control strategy for injection pulse, ignition advance angle, injection and ignition timing control is also put forward. To insure the integrality of engine work sequence, a relative error correction mechanism is introduced to re-execute the failed event. The bench test results approve that the engine work process is stable and reliable under the developed control strategy, both the injection and ignition control signals are correctively performed, the timing control strategy is highly precise and effective.
